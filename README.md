# Our Fishing Project

## Project Goal(Topic)
- To create a prediction model about catching fish. The model will give a prediction on what conditions are favorable 
to catch certain fish that will allow the user to have a better idea of what to fish for in order to leave with a catch.

-----------------------------

## Questions we want to answer
- How likely are you to catch 'name' fish and in what conditions are favorable to achieve a high success rate?

---------------------------

## Group communication protocols

- Throughout this project the group has constantly made contact through the slack app and zoom. 
- This includes sharing information that we find online, code & arranging meetings at least once a week.

**Team Responsibilties**
***De'Ja*** - contributor (square)
***Chandler*** - contributor (circle)
***Chris*** - contributor (triangle)
***Anthony*** - contributor (x)

--------------------------

## Getting Started (Segement 1 Deliverable)
- The group will come together and decide what topic we would like choose for our project.
- Will find out where our data will come from
- Create github repo and branches for all 4 members
- Roles will be distributed and at least 4 commits will be initiated
- Group will select what technologies will be used. 

## Exploratory Data 

The data will be sourced from (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)

--------------------------------

## Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- The group will be using PostgresSQL or SQLlite for our database and have the data cleaned. Once cleaned, the Data will
then go into a machine learning transformation which will need fine tuning to get the answer to the questions we have listed above.
Here is a screenshot of the data put into a machine learning model. 

----------------------------

## Database

- The team connected python with PostGresSQL and created a database
Below is a sample of the database.
