## Team Vand Communication Protocols:

- Our primary modes of communication were Slack and Zoom. Throughout the week, we frequently shared online information and code updates. We arranged meetings atleast once a week outside of class as insurance against any miscommunication. This allowed for us to stay on one accord throughout the project, coming to a common consensus each step of the way. Slack was most beneficial for questions that needed answering on the fly, sending links, and additional commentary.
