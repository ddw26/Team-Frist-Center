    --  Free stock images were used for parts of this project. 
## Project Goal(Topic)
- To create a prediction model about catching fish. The model will give a prediction on what conditions are favorable 
for the user so they don't end up going home empty handed! 


-----------------------------

## Questions we want to answer
- How likely are you to catch 'name' fish and in what conditions are favorable to achieve a high success rate?

---------------------------

## Group communication protocols
- Throughout this project the group has constantly made contact through the slack app and zoom. 
- This includes sharing information that we find online, code & arranging meetings at least once a week.

**Team Responsibilties**

***De'Ja*** - contributor (square_role github repo)

***Chandler*** - contributor (circle_role mockup database)

***Chris*** - contributor (triangle_role machine learning)

***Anthony*** - contributor (x role_technology flow)

--------------------------

## Getting Started/Sketching it out (Segment 1 Deliverable)
- The group will come together and decide what topic we would like choose for our project.
- Will find out where our data will come from
- Create github repo and branches for all 4 members
- Roles will be distributed and at least 4 commits will be initiated
- Group will select what technologies will be used.

## Exploratory Data 

The data will be sourced from (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)

----------------------------

## Database

- The team connected the database using PdAdmin and created a database as seen below.

**SEE VIDEO BELOW**

----------------------------

## Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- The group will be using Postgres or SQLlite for our database and have the data cleaned. Once cleaned, the Data will
then go into a machine learning transformation which will need fine tuning to get the answer to the questions we have listed above.
Here is a screenshot of the data put into a machine learning model.
